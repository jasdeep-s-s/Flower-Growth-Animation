# FlowerGrowth

A simple Java Swing application demonstrating animated flower petal growth.

## Features

- **Smooth Petal Animation**  
  Animated petals "grow" around a flower center using Swing's rendering and timer mechanics.

- **Antialiased Graphics**  
  Uses Graphics2D for smoother visual effects.

- **Customizable Petals & Colors**  
  Easily adjust center size, petal length, colors, and animation speed.

## How It Works

The main window renders a flower with petals that gradually extend outward from the center, achieving a growth animation effect. Animation is managed using a `javax.swing.Timer`.
